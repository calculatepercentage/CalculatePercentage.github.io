            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h1>What Is Percentage?</h1>
            <p>A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is used to represent how much one quantity is in relation to another. For example, if a student scores 80 out of 100 on a test, their score is 80%. The percentage symbol "%" signifies this relationship, making it easier to understand proportions, rates, or comparisons. Percentages are widely used in various fields, such as finance, education, sales, and statistics, to calculate discounts, interest rates, and changes in value, simplifying complex numbers into easy-to-understand figures.</p>
            <h1>How Do You Calculate A Percentage?</h1>
            <p>To calculate a percentage, you need to divide the part (smaller number) by the whole (larger number) and then multiply the result by 100. For example, if you have 50 apples and want to know what percentage of them are red, and 20 of them are red, divide 20 by 50 to get 0.4. Then, multiply 0.4 by 100 to get 40%. This tells you that 40% of the apples are red. This simple formula can be applied to calculate percentages for various scenarios such as discounts, tax, growth, and more.</p>
            <h1>Why Percentages Matter?</h1>
            <p>Percentages are crucial in everyday life as they help simplify complex data and make it easier to compare and understand values. Whether you're calculating discounts, tax rates, or interest on savings, percentages provide a standardized way of expressing changes. They are also essential in fields like business, economics, and education. For instance, businesses use percentages to determine profit margins and growth rates, while students use them to understand exam scores. In essence, percentages offer a clear and concise method to quantify and compare values, making decision-making and problem-solving more efficient across various sectors.</p>
